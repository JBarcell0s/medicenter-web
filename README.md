# medicenter-web
My first front-end website in HTML and CSS language.

I made this layout with my teacher watching my class on B7Web (course), I really enjoyed making this site and I'm happy because I understood what I did.

Im confused yet about using:
- align-items
- align-content
- justify-content

I understood better about "container" doing this code. thx for @juninhopo and @filipedev by helping me.
